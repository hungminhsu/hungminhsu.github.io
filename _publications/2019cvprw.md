excerpt: 'Due to the exponential grow of traffic camera networks, the need of multi-camera tracking (MCT) for intelligent transportation has received more and more attentions. The challenges of MCT include similar vehicle models, large feature variation in different orientations, color variation of the same car due to lighting conditions, small object sizes and frequent occlusion, as well as the varied resolutions of videos. In this work, we propose an MCT system, which combines single-camera tracking (SCT), deep feature re-identification and camera link models for inter-camera tracking (ICT). For SCT, we use a TrackletNet Tracker (TNT) , which effectively generates the moving trajectories of all detected vehicles by exploiting temporal and appearance information of multiple tracklets that are created by associating bounding boxes of detected vehicles. The tracklets are generated based on CNN feature matching and intersection-over-union (IOU) in every single-camera view. In terms of deep feature re-identification, we exploit temporal attention model to extract the most discriminant feature of each trajectory. In addition, we propose the trajectory-based camera link models with order constraint to efficiently leverage the spatial and temporal information for ICT. The proposed method is evaluated on CVPR AI City Challenge 2019 City Flow dataset, achieving IDF1 70.59%, which outperforms competing methods.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WS2Q6yhMxdI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>'
