I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in ECE at University of Washington, interested in Computer Vision, Recommendation System, Text Mining and Deep Learning. At UW, I am working with [Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/) and  the [Information Prcoessing Lab](https://ipl-uw.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. Degree at National Taiwan University in 2017. My recent research interests lie around multi-target multi-camera tracking (i.e., including multi-object tracking and Re-identification) anomaly detection and gait recognition.
